# Chassis-iOS
A wrapper for AVAudioEngine to help create basic and prosumer multi-track audio applications on iOS.

Chassis is written to abstract away some of the gritty parts of CoreAudio present in multi-track AVAudioEngine usage.

Chassis is not meant to be a pro-audio framework, as it abstracts away certain sample-locked parts from the user.
Having said that, its main purpose is to facilitate the entry-point to multi-track audio for consumer applications on iOS.

Chassis relies on Combine, so I have decided to make it iOS 13 +. 

I'll soon be updating this file with a (long!) list of issues I'd like to address...collaborators are welcome!

I will also be updating this readme with notes about how Chassis is written, and some of its shortcomings.

Until I can do that, please feel free to write me directly at rawbirdtoe --(at)-- g mail dot com.
